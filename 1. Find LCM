# 1. Write a Python Program to Find LCM?

# This program will compute the GCD first and computes the LCM of the given number.
# To compute the GCD:
def gcd(x,y):

   while(y):
       x, y = y, x % y
   return x

# To compute LCM
def lcm(x, y):
   lcm = (x*y)//gcd(x,y)
   return lcm

x = 6
y = 7

print("The LCM is", lcm(x, y))
